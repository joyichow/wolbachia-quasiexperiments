**Project description**

Wolbachia symbiosis in Aedes aegypti is an emerging biocontrol measure against dengue. However, assessing its real-world efficacy is challenging due to the non-randomised, field-based nature of most intervention studies. This study re-evaluates the spatial-temporal impact of Wolbachia interventions on dengue incidence in Malaysia (Selangor), Singapore and Brazil (Niteroi) using  a large battery of quasi-experimental methods (pre-post, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity design, synthetic control method, count synthetic control method) and assesses each method’s validity through placebo tests and simulations study (ASEI-SEIR model).
